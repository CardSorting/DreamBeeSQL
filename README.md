> **"Finally, an ORM that doesn't make me feel dumb."** - Every Developer Ever

**NOORMME** (pronounced "normie") makes your SQLite file work like a PostgreSQL server. 

No setup. No configuration. Just point it at your database and start coding.

## ü§î Why Should You Care?

### **The Problem:**
Most developers think SQLite is just for prototypes and PostgreSQL is for "real" apps. So they:
- Set up complex database servers they don't need
- Write tons of boilerplate code for simple database operations
- Spend hours configuring ORMs and managing database connections
- Deal with network latency and server management headaches

### **The NOORMME Solution:**
Your SQLite file gets all the power of PostgreSQL, but:
- **No server setup** - It's just a file on your computer
- **No configuration** - Works out of the box
- **No boilerplate** - Methods are generated automatically
- **No network delays** - Direct file access is lightning fast
- **No server management** - Just copy the file and you're done

### **Real Benefits:**
- üöÄ **Faster development** - Start coding in 60 seconds, not 60 minutes
- üí∞ **Lower costs** - No database server hosting fees
- üîß **Easier deployment** - One file instead of a whole database server
- ‚ö° **Better performance** - Direct file access beats network calls every time
- üõ°Ô∏è **Simpler security** - No network attack surface to worry about

**Bottom line:** You get enterprise database features without enterprise complexity.

## üöÄ What's the Big Deal?

**Before NOORMME:** You write SQL by hand, manage types manually, and pray everything works.

**With NOORMME:** Your SQLite file automatically becomes a fully-featured database with:
- ‚úÖ Auto-generated TypeScript types
- ‚úÖ Smart repository methods  
- ‚úÖ Relationship handling
- ‚úÖ Performance optimization
- ‚úÖ Production-ready features

**It's literally just a file that acts like a server.** ü§Ø

## ‚ö° Get Started in 60 Seconds

### 1. Install It
```bash
npm install noormme
```

### 2. Connect to Your Database
```typescript
import { NOORMME } from 'noormme'

const db = new NOORMME({
  dialect: 'sqlite',
  connection: {
    database: './your-database.sqlite'  // Point to your existing database
  }
})

await db.initialize()
```

### 3. Start Using Auto-Generated Methods
```typescript
// NOORMME automatically finds your 'users' table and creates methods
const userRepo = db.getRepository('users')

// These methods are automatically available based on your table columns:
const users = await userRepo.findAll()
const user = await userRepo.findByEmail('john@example.com')
const activeUsers = await userRepo.findManyByStatus('active')

// Full CRUD with type safety
const newUser = await userRepo.create({
  name: 'Jane Doe',
  email: 'jane@example.com'
})
```

**That's it!** Your SQLite file now works like a PostgreSQL server. üéâ

## üéØ What NOORMME Does For You

### üîç **Auto-Discovery**
NOORMME looks at your database and figures out:
- What tables you have
- What columns are in each table
- How tables are related to each other
- What data types everything is

### üèóÔ∏è **Auto-Generated Types**
Instead of writing TypeScript interfaces by hand:
```typescript
// NOORMME automatically generates this for you:
interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
  email: string
  status: 'active' | 'inactive'
  createdAt: Date
}
```

### üöÄ **Smart Repository Methods**
Based on your table columns, NOORMME creates methods like:
- `findById(id)` - Find by primary key
- `findByEmail(email)` - Find by email column
- `findManyByStatus(status)` - Find multiple by status
- `create(data)` - Create new records
- `update(id, data)` - Update existing records
- `delete(id)` - Delete records

### ‚ö° **Performance Optimization**
NOORMME automatically:
- Enables WAL mode for better concurrency
- Sets optimal cache sizes
- Recommends indexes for faster queries
- Monitors query performance

## üî• WAL Mode: Why This Changes Everything

**The Problem:** Most SQLite databases are slow and lock up when multiple people try to use them at the same time. It's like having a single-lane road for a busy intersection.

**The NOORMME Solution:** WAL Mode (Write-Ahead Logging) turns your SQLite file into a multi-lane highway.

### **What WAL Mode Actually Does (In Plain English):**

**Before WAL Mode:**
- When someone writes to the database, EVERYONE has to wait
- Reading data blocks writing data (and vice versa)
- Your app freezes when multiple users try to do things at once
- It's like having one checkout lane at Walmart on Black Friday

**With NOORMME's WAL Mode:**
- ‚úÖ **Multiple readers can access data simultaneously** - No more waiting in line
- ‚úÖ **Writers don't block readers** - Updates happen in the background
- ‚úÖ **3x faster write operations** - Append-only logging is lightning fast
- ‚úÖ **Better crash recovery** - Your data is safer than ever
- ‚úÖ **Real production performance** - Handles thousands of concurrent users

### **Real-World Proof:**
NOORMME's WAL Mode is already running in production at **DreamBeesArt**, where it:
- Handles multiple users creating and editing content simultaneously
- Processes orders and inventory updates without blocking customer browsing
- Maintains sub-second response times even under heavy load
- Provides enterprise-level reliability in a simple SQLite file

### **The Magic Behind the Scenes:**
Instead of one database file, WAL Mode creates three files:
- `your-database.db` - Your actual data (the main file)
- `your-database.db-wal` - Pending changes (like a shopping cart)
- `your-database.db-shm` - Coordination between processes (like traffic lights)

**Don't worry** - NOORMME handles all three files automatically. You just see your database working like a high-performance server.

### **Why You Should Care:**
- üöÄ **Your app won't freeze** when multiple users are active
- üí∞ **Save money** - No need for expensive database servers
- üîß **Easier deployment** - Copy one file instead of managing servers
- ‚ö° **Better user experience** - Everything feels snappy and responsive
- üõ°Ô∏è **More reliable** - Your data is safer with better crash recovery

**Bottom line:** Your SQLite file becomes as powerful as PostgreSQL, but without the complexity.

## üõ†Ô∏è CLI Tools (For When You Want to Feel Like a Pro)

NOORMME includes command-line tools that make database management stupidly simple:

### Analyze Your Database
```bash
# See what's slow and get recommendations
npx noormme analyze --database ./app.sqlite
```

### Optimize Performance
```bash
# Make your database faster automatically
npx noormme optimize --database ./app.sqlite
```

### Watch and Auto-Optimize
```bash
# Set it and forget it - NOORMME watches your database
npx noormme watch --auto-optimize
```

## üí° Real Examples

### Blog App
```typescript
const db = new NOORMME({
  dialect: 'sqlite',
  connection: { database: './blog.sqlite' }
})

await db.initialize()

// Auto-generated repositories
const postRepo = db.getRepository('posts')
const userRepo = db.getRepository('users')

// Smart methods based on your schema
const recentPosts = await postRepo.findManyByPublished(true)
const adminUsers = await userRepo.findManyByRole('admin')

// Complex queries with full type safety
const postWithAuthor = await db.getKysely()
  .selectFrom('posts')
  .innerJoin('users', 'users.id', 'posts.author_id')
  .select(['posts.title', 'users.name as author'])
  .where('posts.published', '=', true)
  .execute()
```

### E-commerce App
```typescript
// Point at your existing e-commerce database
const db = new NOORMME({
  dialect: 'sqlite',
  connection: { database: './shop.sqlite' }
})

await db.initialize()

const productRepo = db.getRepository('products')
const orderRepo = db.getRepository('orders')

// Auto-generated methods work with your existing data
const featuredProducts = await productRepo.findManyByFeatured(true)
const pendingOrders = await orderRepo.findManyByStatus('pending')
```

## üîß Configuration (Optional)

For most people, the default settings work perfectly. But if you want to customize:

```typescript
const db = new NOORMME({
  dialect: 'sqlite',
  connection: {
    database: './app.sqlite'
  },
  automation: {
    enableAutoOptimization: true,     // Make it fast automatically
    enableIndexRecommendations: true, // Suggest better indexes
    enableQueryAnalysis: true,        // Find slow queries
  },
  performance: {
    enableCaching: true,              // Cache results for speed
    maxCacheSize: 1000               // How much to cache
  }
})
```

## üöÄ Production Ready

NOORMME is already running in production applications with real-world success stories. It includes:
