# NOORMME Implementation Strategy

## Overview

This directory contains the consolidated, coherent implementation strategy for NOORMME - a batteries-included framework for Next.js that eliminates setup friction through proven patterns and existing tools.

## Strategy Documents

### 1. [CORE-STRATEGY.md](./CORE-STRATEGY.md)
**The definitive implementation strategy** - Consolidated from all previous documents, removing contradictions and focusing on feasible, implementable functionality.

### 2. [IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md](./IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md)
**Detailed implementation plan** - Phase-by-phase breakdown with specific deliverables, timelines, and success criteria.

### 3. [TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md](./TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md)
**Technical architecture decisions** - How we'll build the framework using modern Next.js patterns and proven tools.

## Key Principles

1. **Start Simple** - Basic functionality that works
2. **Proven Tools** - Use existing, stable libraries
3. **Incremental** - Add features based on actual needs
4. **Realistic** - Set achievable goals and timelines

## Core Mission

**NOORMME** is a batteries-included framework for Next.js that eliminates setup friction through:

- **Zero-Config Setup** - Working app in 5 minutes
- **Core Features** - Database, Auth, Admin, RBAC
- **Modern Patterns** - Server Components, Server Actions, Edge Runtime
- **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript integration
- **Production Ready** - Security, testing, documentation

**Not Django's API, Django's experience.**
**Not Laravel's complexity, Laravel's productivity.**
**Not Rails' magic, Rails' conventions.**
**Just Next.js with batteries included.**

## What We're Building

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- CLI scaffolding tool (`create-noormme-app`)
- SQLite setup with Kysely
- NextAuth integration
- Basic admin dashboard
- User management

### Phase 2: Admin Panel & RBAC (Weeks 5-8)
- Complete admin panel with CRUD
- RBAC system (roles & permissions)
- Middleware protection
- Admin role management

### Phase 3: CLI Commands & Polish (Weeks 9-12)
- Basic CLI commands (`generate:model`, `make:migration`)
- Migration system
- Testing setup
- Documentation

## Success Criteria

### Technical Excellence
- ⚡ **Setup Time**: < 5 minutes (realistic)
- 🎯 **Type Safety**: 95%+ (Kysely provides this)
- 🚄 **Performance**: < 50ms queries (SQLite is fast)
- 🛡️ **Security**: Basic RBAC working

### Adoption Metrics (12 months)
- 📦 **NPM Downloads**: 10,000+ monthly (realistic)
- ⭐ **GitHub Stars**: 1,000+ (realistic)
- 🚀 **Production Apps**: 100+ (realistic)
- 👥 **Active Users**: 1,000+ (realistic)

## Next Steps

1. **Review Core Strategy** - Read [CORE-STRATEGY.md](./CORE-STRATEGY.md)
2. **Understand Implementation** - Read [IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md](./IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md)
3. **Technical Details** - Read [TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md](./TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md)
4. **Begin Implementation** - Start with Phase 1

---

**Status**: ✅ Strategy consolidated and ready for implementation
**Timeline**: 3 months to working framework, 12 months to community adoption
**Goal**: Make Next.js development as productive as Django/Laravel/Rails, but with modern web patterns and TypeScript
