# NOORMME Development Handoff Checklist

## 🎯 Quick Summary

**What is NOORMME?**
Django-style API wrapper built on top of Kysely for Next.js + SQLite + NextAuth applications.

**Tech Stack:**
```
Next.js 13+ (App Router)
├── NextAuth (authentication)
├── NOORMME (Django-style API)
│   └── Kysely (type-safe query builder)
│       └── SQLite (database with WAL mode)
```

**Key Principle:**
We don't build a query builder - we wrap Kysely with Django's intuitive API patterns.

## ✅ What's Already Built

### Phase 1: Core Foundation ✅
- [x] Kysely integration with SQLite
- [x] Basic Manager class
- [x] QuerySet with `.filter()`, `.exclude()`, `.get()`, `.all()`
- [x] Type safety through Kysely's inference

### Phase 2: Auto-Discovery ✅
- [x] SQLite schema introspection
- [x] TypeScript type generation
- [x] Dynamic model creation
- [x] Relationship detection

### Phase 3: Next.js Integration ✅
- [x] Server Component compatibility
- [x] Server Actions support
- [x] Edge Runtime compatibility
- [x] Connection pooling

### Phase 4: NextAuth Adapter ✅
- [x] NextAuth Adapter implementation
- [x] Auth table schemas
- [x] Type-safe auth operations
- [x] Session management

## 🚧 What Still Needs Work

### Phase 5: Enhanced Relationship Loading 🔄
Priority: **HIGH**

- [ ] Improve `prefetch()` implementation
- [ ] Add nested relationship support (`prefetch('author.profile')`)
- [ ] Optimize N+1 query prevention
- [ ] Add lazy loading helpers

**Why Important:** Core Django feature that users expect

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks

**Files to Work On:**
```
src/core/queryset.ts         # Add prefetch logic
src/core/relationships.ts    # Relationship resolution
tests/core/prefetch.test.ts  # Comprehensive tests
```

**Key Challenge:** Mapping Django-style prefetch to Kysely joins while preserving types

### Phase 6: Advanced Query Features 📋
Priority: **MEDIUM**

- [ ] Aggregation helpers (`Count()`, `Sum()`, `Avg()`)
- [ ] `Q` objects for complex queries
- [ ] `.annotate()` for computed fields
- [ ] `.distinct()` support

**Why Important:** Power users need these for complex queries

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 weeks

### Phase 7: Migration System 📋
Priority: **MEDIUM**

- [ ] Simple migration generation
- [ ] Schema diffing
- [ ] Migration execution
- [ ] Rollback support

**Why Important:** Needed for production use

**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 weeks

**Note:** Keep it simple - not trying to replicate Django migrations fully

### Phase 8: Developer Experience 📋
Priority: **LOW** (but high impact)

- [ ] Better error messages
- [ ] Query debugging tools
- [ ] Performance warnings
- [ ] CLI tools

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks

## 🔑 Critical Implementation Details

### 1. Type Safety is Non-Negotiable

```typescript
// ❌ NEVER do this
class Manager {
  objects: QuerySet<any>;
}

// ✅ ALWAYS preserve Kysely's types
class Manager<DB, TB extends keyof DB> {
  objects: QuerySet<DB, TB, DB[TB]>;
}
```

### 2. Always Wrap Kysely, Never Replace

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Wrap Kysely
class QuerySet {
  filter(conditions) {
    this.kyselyQuery = this.kyselyQuery.where(/* ... */);
    return this;
  }
}

// ❌ Bad: Reimplement query building
class QuerySet {
  filter(conditions) {
    // Don't manually build SQL strings!
  }
}
```

### 3. Provide Escape Hatch to Raw Kysely

```typescript
// Users should always be able to drop to Kysely
const complexQuery = await db.kysely
  .selectFrom('users')
  .where(/* complex Kysely query */)
  .execute();
```

### 4. Schema Caching is Critical

```typescript
// ❌ Don't introspect on every request
const schema = await introspectDatabase(db);

// ✅ Cache the schema
let schemaCache = null;
const schema = schemaCache || (schemaCache = await introspectDatabase(db));
```

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Must Have Tests For:
- [ ] All QuerySet methods (filter, exclude, get, all, etc.)
- [ ] Type generation from various SQLite schemas
- [ ] NextAuth adapter (all methods)
- [ ] Relationship loading (prefetch, lazy)
- [ ] Edge cases (empty results, multiple results, etc.)

### Test Coverage Target: 80%+

**Run tests:**
```bash
npm test
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: Edge Runtime Compatibility
**Problem:** `better-sqlite3` doesn't work in Edge Runtime
**Workaround:** Use Turso/LibSQL for Edge deployments
**Status:** Documented, needs testing

### Issue 2: Complex Relationship Loading
**Problem:** Nested prefetch not fully implemented
**Workaround:** Users can use raw Kysely joins
**Status:** In progress (Phase 5)

### Issue 3: Type Generation for Complex Schemas
**Problem:** Some SQLite types don't map perfectly to TypeScript
**Workaround:** Manual type overrides
**Status:** Documented, acceptable for now

## 🚀 Quick Start for Development

## 📞 Questions to Answer Before Proceeding

1. **What's the priority?** Relationship loading, migrations, or DX improvements?
2. **Target users?** Kysely users, Django migrants, or Next.js beginners?

## ✨ Remember

**Core Principle:** We're building Django's intuitive API on top of Kysely's rock-solid foundation for Next.js developers. Keep it simple, keep it type-safe, and always provide an escape hatch to raw Kysely.

**When in doubt:** Check how Django does it, then implement it using Kysely underneath.
