|----------|----------|-------------|
| `HANDOFF-CHECKLIST.md` | `00-START-HERE.md` | Clearer entry point, numbered |
| `QUICK-REFERENCE.md` | `01-QUICK-REFERENCE.md` | Added number for order |

| `mission-statement.md` | `03-MISSION-STATEMENT.md` | Consistent case + number |
| `strategic-pivot-summary.md` | `04-STRATEGY-AND-POSITIONING.md` | Clearer name + number |
| `performance-refactoring.md` | `05-ARCHITECTURE-REFACTORING.md` | More accurate name + number |
| `phase-completion-reports/` | `historical-phase-reports/` | Clearer that it's historical |

### 3. **Obvious Entry Point**
`00-START-HERE.md` clearly indicates where to begin

### 4. **Self-Documenting**
Names describe content and purpose clearly

### 5. **Easy Navigation**
Files sort alphabetically in the order they should be read

### 6. **Historical Separation**
`historical-phase-reports/` clearly separates past from current
