# Performance Module Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The performance module has been completely refactored from monolithic, assumption-heavy code into focused services, utilities, and classes with clear responsibilities and no legacy dependencies.

## Problems with Original Architecture

### 1. Monolithic Design
- **Single Responsibility Violation**: Classes handling multiple concerns
- **Tight Coupling**: Components dependent on each other
- **Hard to Test**: Complex interdependencies
- **Hard to Maintain**: Changes required understanding entire system

### 2. Hidden Assumptions
- **Database-Specific Logic**: Assumed SQLite without clear abstraction
- **Framework Dependencies**: Assumed specific patterns without flexibility
- **Performance Assumptions**: Hard-coded thresholds and behaviors
- **Configuration Assumptions**: Default values scattered throughout code

### 3. Legacy Code Issues
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintaining old APIs for compatibility
- **Deprecated Patterns**: Outdated code patterns and practices
- **Inconsistent Interfaces**: Different APIs for similar functionality
- **Technical Debt**: Accumulated complexity over time

## Refactoring Strategy

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Query Parsing**: Dedicated utility for SQL analysis
- **Caching**: Generic cache service with TTL and metrics
- **Metrics Collection**: Performance monitoring and analysis
- **Connection Management**: Database connection lifecycle
- **Query Optimization**: High-level optimization orchestration

### 2. Service-Oriented Architecture
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service has one clear purpose
- **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate through well-defined interfaces
- **High Cohesion**: Related functionality grouped together
- **Testability**: Each service can be tested independently

### 3. Clean Interfaces
- **Consistent APIs**: Similar patterns across all services
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper types
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- **Configuration**: Clear, documented configuration options

## New Architecture
