# Strategic Pivot Summary

## Overview

NOORMME has undergone a comprehensive strategic pivot from a generic ORM to a Next.js + SQLite specialized solution, inspired by Django's ORM principles while maintaining framework independence.

## Strategic Vision

### Core Mission
"Django's ORM Without The Framework Prison"

Build a production-ready ORM that brings Django's powerful patterns to Next.js applications without locking developers into a specific framework.

### Key Principles

1. **Next.js First**: Optimized for Next.js App Router patterns
2. **SQLite Specialized**: Leverage SQLite's strengths with WAL mode
3. **Django Inspired**: Bring Django's best ORM patterns to JavaScript
4. **Framework Independent**: No lock-in, works with any existing database
5. **Production Ready**: Built for scale, performance, and reliability

## Strategic Changes

### 1. Framework Focus Shift

**Before:**
- Generic ORM supporting multiple frameworks
- Broad compatibility across different ecosystems
- Generic database abstractions

**After:**
- Next.js-first development approach
- App Router optimization patterns
- Server Components and Server Actions integration
- Edge Runtime compatibility

### 2. Database Strategy Evolution

**Before:**
- Multi-database support (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
- Generic SQL generation
- Database-agnostic abstractions

**After:**
- SQLite-first approach
- WAL mode optimization for concurrency
- SQLite-specific performance tuning
- Auto-discovery of existing schemas

### 3. Development Methodology

**Before:**
- Feature-driven development
- Ad-hoc optimization
- Legacy code maintenance

**After:**
- Phase-based development approach
- Systematic production readiness
- Clean architecture with focused services
- Comprehensive testing and benchmarking

### 4. Architecture Refactoring

**Before:**
- Monolithic performance modules
- Mixed concerns and responsibilities
- Legacy code and backward compatibility

**After:**
- Focused services with single responsibilities
- Clear separation of concerns
- Modern TypeScript patterns
- Clean, maintainable codebase

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Stability & Testing ✅
