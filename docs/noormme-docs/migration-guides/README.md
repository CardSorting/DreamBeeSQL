# PostgreSQL to SQLite Migration with Noormme

This directory contains detailed migration guides based on the successful migration of the DreamBeesArt application from PostgreSQL to SQLite using Noormme.

## Migration Overview

We successfully migrated a complex Next.js application with:
- NextAuth authentication system
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Caching layer with Redis
- BullMQ task management
- Complex API routes
- TypeScript with strict type checking

## Migration Guides

### Core Migration Steps

1. **[01-basic-setup.md](./01-basic-setup.md)** - Initial Noormme setup and configuration
2. **[02-database-layer.md](./02-database-layer.md)** - Migrating database connection and initialization
3. **[03-repository-migration.md](./03-repository-migration.md)** - Converting direct database calls to repository pattern
4. **[04-kysely-migration.md](./04-kysely-migration.md)** - Migrating complex queries to Noormme's Kysely integration
5. **[05-type-safety.md](./05-type-safety.md)** - Fixing TypeScript issues and ensuring type safety

### Integration-Specific Guides

6. **[06-nextauth-adapter.md](./06-nextauth-adapter.md)** - Creating custom NextAuth adapter for Noormme
7. **[07-rbac-system.md](./07-rbac-system.md)** - Migrating role-based access control system
8. **[08-caching-layer.md](./08-caching-layer.md)** - Updating cached database service
9. **[09-api-routes.md](./09-api-routes.md)** - Migrating API routes to use Noormme
10. **[10-monitoring-health.md](./10-monitoring-health.md)** - Database health checks and monitoring

### Advanced Topics

11. **[11-data-migration.md](./11-data-migration.md)** - Scripts for migrating data from PostgreSQL to SQLite
12. **[12-performance-optimization.md](./12-performance-optimization.md)** - SQLite optimization and performance tuning
13. **[13-production-deployment.md](./13-production-deployment.md)** - Production considerations and deployment
14. **[14-troubleshooting.md](./14-troubleshooting.md)** - Common issues and solutions during migration

## Migration Results

### Before Migration
- PostgreSQL database with complex connection pooling
- Direct Kysely queries throughout the codebase
- TypeScript errors due to mixed database patterns
- Complex deployment with database server requirements

### After Migration
- ✅ Single SQLite file database
- ✅ Repository pattern with Noormme
- ✅ Type-safe Kysely integration
- ✅ Production-ready with health monitoring
- ✅ Simplified deployment (no database server)
- ✅ Improved performance with SQLite optimizations

## Key Benefits Achieved

1. **Simplified Deployment**: No separate database server required
2. **Better Performance**: SQLite optimized for read-heavy workloads
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with Noormme
4. **Production Features**: Health checks, monitoring, and optimization
5. **Maintainability**: Clean repository pattern throughout codebase
6. **Cost Reduction**: No database server hosting costs

## Migration Timeline

- **Setup & Configuration**: 1-2 hours
- **Core Database Migration**: 2-3 hours
- **Authentication System**: 1-2 hours
- **RBAC & Caching**: 2-3 hours
- **API Routes**: 1-2 hours
- **Type Safety & Testing**: 2-3 hours
- **Total**: ~10-15 hours for a complex application

## Prerequisites

Before starting the migration:

1. **Backup your PostgreSQL database**
2. **Understand your current database schema**
3. **Identify all database access patterns**
4. **Plan for data migration**
5. **Set up testing environment**

## Getting Started

Begin with [01-basic-setup.md](./01-basic-setup.md) to set up Noormme, then follow the guides in order. Each guide builds upon the previous ones and includes real code examples from our migration.

## Support

These guides are based on a real production migration. If you encounter issues not covered here, refer to the main documentation or create an issue with your specific use case.
