#### 8. Type Safety Could Be Enhanced
**Impact**: Low - Developer experience
**Effort**: Low - 1 week
**Description**: Type safety is good but could be enhanced in some areas

**Current State**:
- Good type safety with Kysely
- Some `any` types in places
- Missing type guards
- Limited generic type support

**Required Implementation**:
- Eliminate `any` types
- Add type guards
- Enhance generic type support
- Improve type inference

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Address incrementally
- Eliminate `any` types
- Add type guards
- Enhance generic support
