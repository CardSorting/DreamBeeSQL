NOORMME Development Handoff: Django for Next.js
Vision Statement
NOORMME is Django's ORM philosophy liberated for Next.js developers.
We're extracting Django's brilliant auto-discovery, migrations, and relationship handling—while leaving behind the framework prison. Built for developers who want Django ORM power with Next.js freedom.

Strategic Direction
Core Focus (Non-Negotiable)

One Framework: Next.js (App Router)
One Database: SQLite
One Philosophy: Django-inspired ORM without framework lock-in

What We're NOT Building

❌ Multi-database support (learned this lesson the hard way)
❌ Universal framework compatibility
❌ Enterprise everything-to-everyone tool
❌ Schema file systems (anti-pattern we're avoiding)

What We ARE Building

✅ Django-style auto-discovery for SQLite
✅ Seamless Next.js integration
✅ NextAuth compatibility (never rewrite auth again)
✅ Production-ready, thoroughly tested
✅ Developer-owned, directly fixable


Technical Architecture
Current State

Status: v1.0 shipped to npm, but needs refinement
What Works: SQLite auto-discovery, basic CRUD, type generation
What Needs Work: Edge cases, thorough testing, NextAuth integration

Core Components
1. Auto-Discovery Engine (Django-Inspired)
typescript// Current implementation
const db = new NOORMME({
  dialect: 'sqlite',
  connection: { filename: './app.db' }
})

await db.initialize() // Discovers schema automatically
Django Inspiration:
python# Django does this with models
class User(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField()
Our Approach: Reverse it—discover existing schema instead of defining it.
Engineer Focus:

Ensure robust schema introspection
Handle SQLite-specific types correctly
Test with various schema patterns (foreign keys, indexes, constraints)


2. WAL Mode Implementation (Accidental Genius)
typescript// Already implemented (discovered accidentally!)
optimization: {
  enableWALMode: true  // Enables concurrent reads/writes
}
What This Gives Us:

PostgreSQL-level concurrent access
Three-file architecture (db, db-wal, db-shm)
Non-blocking reads/writes
Crash recovery

Engineer Focus:

Document WAL mode benefits clearly
Test concurrent access scenarios
Ensure proper cleanup and checkpoint handling
Verify crash recovery works as expected


3. Migration System (Django-Inspired)
typescript// Current implementation
import { createNodeMigrationManager } from 'noorm'

const migrationManager = await createNodeMigrationManager(db, {
  migrationsDirectory: './migrations'
})

await migrationManager.migrate()
Django Inspiration:
bashpython manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
Engineer Focus:

SQL-based migrations (simple, transparent)
Migration rollback support
Migration conflict detection
Clean migration file generation


4. Repository Pattern
typescriptconst userRepo = db.getRepository('users')

// Basic CRUD
await userRepo.findAll()
await userRepo.findById(id)
await userRepo.create(data)
await userRepo.update(data)
await userRepo.delete(id)

// Relationships (Django-inspired)
await userRepo.findWithRelations(id, ['posts', 'comments'])
Engineer Focus:

Consistent API across all operations
Type-safe repository methods
Efficient relationship loading (avoid N+1)
Support for nested relationships


Priority Work Items
Phase 1: Stability & Testing (Weeks 1-2)
1.1 Edge Case Testing
Context: Production revealed edge cases we didn't catch in testing.
Tasks:

 Create comprehensive test suite for SQLite schema variations
 Test with different SQLite pragma settings
 Test concurrent access scenarios (WAL mode validation)
 Test relationship loading edge cases (circular refs, deep nesting)
 Test migration rollback scenarios
 Security audit follow-up (address findings)

Test Coverage Goals:

Core operations: 100%
Edge cases: 90%+
Integration with Next.js: Full happy path + common errors


1.2 NextAuth Integration (Critical)
Context: Goal is "never rewrite auth again"
Current Challenge: Making NOORMME work seamlessly with NextAuth adapters
Tasks:

 Create NextAuth adapter for NOORMME
 Test with NextAuth OAuth providers
 Test with NextAuth credentials provider
 Document setup process (must be simple)
 Create example Next.js app with auth working

Success Criteria:
typescript// Should be this simple:
import { NoormmeAdapter } from 'noormme/nextauth'

export const authOptions = {
  adapter: NoormmeAdapter(db),
  // ... rest of NextAuth config
}
Example App Requirements:

Full auth flow (sign in, sign out, session)
Protected routes
User profile
Clean, copy-paste-able code


Phase 2: Developer Experience (Weeks 3-4)
2.1 Error Messages
Context: Getting kicked by clever code taught us—errors need to be helpful.
Tasks:

 Implement descriptive error classes
 Add context to all error throws
 Suggest fixes in error messages
 Test error messages with real scenarios

Example:
typescript// Bad (current)
Error: Column not found

// Good (target)
NoormError: Column 'user_name' not found in table 'users'
  → Did you mean 'username'? (82% similarity match)
  → Available columns: id, username, email, created_at
  
  Fix: Check your column name or run db.inspect('users')

2.2 Type Generation Quality
Context: Full TypeScript safety is a core promise
Tasks:

 Ensure all SQLite types map correctly to TypeScript
 Generate types for relationships
 Support nullable columns properly
 Test type generation with complex schemas

Expected Output:
typescript// Auto-generated from schema
interface User {
  id: number
  username: string
  email: string
  created_at: Date
  bio: string | null
}

## Django's ORM Without The Framework Prison

Django has a brilliant ORM:
- Auto-discovery
- Powerful migrations
- Elegant relationship handling

But using it means living in Django's framework.

NOORMME brings Django's ORM brilliance to Next.js:
- Same auto-discovery philosophy
- Same migration power
- Same relationship elegance
- But with Next.js freedom

You get:
- Django ORM patterns ✅
- React components ✅
- Server/Client components ✅
- Modern TypeScript ✅
- No framework lock-in ✅

Phase 3: Production Readiness (Weeks 5-6)
3.1 Performance Optimization
Tasks:

 Query optimization (ensure WAL mode benefits are realized)
 Connection pooling for Next.js serverless
 Batch operation support
 Performance benchmarking suite


3.2 Next.js Integration Patterns
Tasks:

 Server Component patterns
 Server Action patterns
 Route Handler patterns
 Middleware integration
 Edge Runtime compatibility testing

Example Patterns to Document:
typescript// Server Component
export default async function UsersPage() {
  const db = await getDB() // Singleton pattern
  const users = await db.getRepository('users').findAll()
  return <UserList users={users} />
}

// Server Action
export async function createUser(formData: FormData) {
  'use server'
  const db = await getDB()
  await db.getRepository('users').create({
    name: formData.get('name'),
    email: formData.get('email')
  })
  revalidatePath('/users')
}

// Route Handler
export async function GET() {
  const db = await getDB()
  const users = await db.getRepository('users').findAll()
  return Response.json(users)
}

✅ SQLite-only focus was correct decision
✅ WAL mode implementation (even if accidental)
✅ Auto-discovery concept works well
✅ Shipping fast validated the idea

What Went Wrong:

❌ Shipped before thorough testing
❌ Didn't anticipate production edge cases
❌ Underestimated complexity of "clever techniques"
❌ Initially tried to support too many databases

Course Corrections:

✅ Now focused on Next.js + SQLite only
✅ Thorough testing before next npm publish
✅ Learning from Django's proven patterns
✅ Building NextAuth integration properly


Development Principles
1. Django-Inspired, Not Django-Copied

Learn from Django's brilliance
Adapt for TypeScript/Next.js world
Don't copy Django's mistakes (framework lock-in)

2. Focus Over Features

Perfect Next.js + SQLite integration
Not trying to be everything to everyone
Deep over wide

3. Developer Ownership
Key Philosophy: "I don't have to dance around issues that aren't my fault—I can fix them directly"
This means:

Clean, readable code
Direct fixes over workarounds
User reports bugs, we fix in library, everyone benefits

4. Test Rigorously
Learned: "Clever techniques need MORE testing, not less"

Comprehensive test coverage
Edge case testing
Integration testing with Next.js
Security testing

5. Ship When Ready
Not: "Ship in 3 days"
But: "Ship when it's actually tested and working"

Example Apps to Build
1. Next.js Starter with Auth (Priority 1)
Purpose: Show the "never rewrite auth again" promise
Features:

NextAuth OAuth (Google, GitHub)
User profile
Protected routes
Session management
Clean, copy-paste code


2. Blog Platform (Priority 2)
Purpose: Show relationships and migrations
Features:

Users, Posts, Comments (relationships)
Migrations from scratch
CRUD operations
Server Components
Server Actions


3. Production Config Example (Priority 3)
Purpose: Show best practices
Features:

WAL mode configuration

Performance optimization
Deployment setup


Non-Goals (Important to State)
What We're NOT Building:

❌ PostgreSQL support (deleted for good reasons)
❌ MySQL support (we have standards)
❌ Real-time subscriptions
❌ GraphQL integration
❌ Admin UI (that's Django's jail cell)
❌ Multi-tenancy (not yet)

Why These Are Non-Goals:
Focus. We're one person building for Next.js + SQLite. Adding these would dilute quality and increase complexity we can't maintain.
If users need these, there are other tools (and that's okay).
